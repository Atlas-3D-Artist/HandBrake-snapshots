# HandBrake Snapshot Builds

HandBrake is an open-source video transcoder available for Linux, Mac, and Windows, licensed under the [GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2](LICENSE).

This repository contains pre-release builds of our main development branch which means they may or may not be stable and probably won't be documented. As such, your mileage may vary.

These development builds are better suited for more experienced users and developers wishing to test the latest code. That said, everyone is welcome to give them a shot and provide feedback.

Please note, these builds are not digitally signed and are built on a public build platform. Use at your own risk! 

### Bugs

If you find issues with these builds then post a thorough bug report on our [Issue Tracker!](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues)
Please don't assume we know about your bug or issue. If you see something that isn't working or doesn't make sense, do tell us!
